# Desktop_Organiser
A very simple Desktop Organiser using python

# File Sorter
I have created a Python GUI application that organizes and sorts your files in a selected directory into categorized folders such as Photos, Documents and General. It uses the tkinter library for the interface and shutil for moving files.
It can be easily modified to support more sorting using more folders based on a file's format.

# Features
Select a directory manually or via a file dialog.
Sorts files by extensions into appropriate folders:
.jpg, .png → Photos
.pdf, .doc, .docx → Documents
.exe → General Programs
Other file types → Other
Alerts you when files have been successfully sorted or if no files were moved.
